# Alert Rules Reference - tx-lookup-service
# ===========================================
#
# Platform-agnostic alert rule definitions.
# Maps OpenTelemetry metric names to threshold/severity decisions.
#
# Decisions: DEC-010 (baseline thresholds), DEC-202 (severity)
# Spec: .specs/backoffice_project_specs.md section 8
#
# Deployment:
#   - Azure Monitor: translate to Scheduled Query Rules (Bicep/Portal) using KQL
#   - Prometheus: translate to alerting rules using PromQL
#
# Azure Monitor note (F3-2):
#   - Workspace-based Application Insights queries use AppMetrics table.
#   - Keep KQL snippets aligned with docs/ops/f3_2_slo_alerts_runbook.md.
#
# Metric sources:
#   - src/common/metrics.py       (api_*, db_*)
#   - src/consumer/metrics.py     (consumer_*, pairing_*)
